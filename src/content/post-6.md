### Description

Instant Lights is a simple shooting game.

### How to play
Move with arrow/wasd keys, and shoot with left click.

There's no specific ending, but you will definitely be addicted once you start playing. 

### Technology

    - HTML5(canvas)  
    - CSS  
    - JavaScript(anime.js, gsap)
